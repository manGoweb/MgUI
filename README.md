`mango-cli` project example
===========================

Do you have `mango-cli` installed globally?

If not: `npm install -g mango-cli`

Init your project
-----------------

Run command `mango init your-project-directory-name`.

Oh, that's it? Go to that directory, run `mango dev` and your browser should start up.
